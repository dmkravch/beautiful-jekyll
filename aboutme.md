My name is Dmytro Kravchenko. I'm a Consulting Engineer working at Cisco, focused on Collaboration Solutions, Cisco Spark and Automation. 

I've decided to establish a blog to share some solutions to technical issues that we are facing during our work.

Hopefully, it will be useful for anyone in need ;)
