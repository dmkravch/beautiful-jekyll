Hello Everyone!

There was a requirement to integrate the Smartsheet platform with Webex Teams. One of the subtasks was to initiate a post to Webex Teams when a new row added in the Smartsheet. It sounded like a trivial task, however, turned out that we spent the whole day configuring it.

Let's start step by step.

### Environment
1. We are using a AWS EC2 AMI Linux instance (t2.small).
2. Flask version is "0.12.2".
3. Smartsheet account.
4. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/products) for creating and testing webhooks.
5. [PutsReq](https://putsreq.com/) for creating "a bin" for initial inspecting responses that will be coming from Smartsheet. And the most important feature that it supports **https**.

## Smartsheet
We've started our journey from the official Smartsheet documentation portal on how to create webhooks - [Creating a Webhook](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/#creating-a-webhook).

We are using Postman for initial development and testing.

So, as described in documentation, there are three important steps to lounch a webhook:
1. Create a webhook
2. Enable the webhook
3. Answer to the smartsheet with the challenge string presented.

> Note: to find the id of the sheet you want to create webhook for, you could use the following python script:
> ~~~python
> import smartsheet
>
> access_token='Your smartsheet API token'
> response = ss_client.Sheets.list_sheets(include_all=True)
> a = response.to_dict()
> ~~~
> And then find name and id of the sheet in question.

Let's tackle each of them separately.

### Create a webhook
On the screenshot below there is the Authorization header, which will be used in any request to Smartsheet:
[![alt text](/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm1.png "Postman Example Auth header")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmkravch/dmkravch.github.io/master/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm1.png)
Please, insert you API token (after the **Bearer** word).

And below is the **body**:
[![alt text](/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm2.png "Postman Example Auth Body")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmkravch/dmkravch.github.io/master/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm2.png)

> Note: Smartsheet supports only well-known https ports (such as 443 or 8443).

As a response, you should get something like this:
~~~json
{
    "message": "SUCCESS",
    "resultCode": 0,
    "result": {
        "id": 1234567890,
        "name": "Webhook dmkravch",
        "scope": "sheet",
        "scopeObjectId": 987654321,
        "events": [
            "*.*"
        ],
        "callbackUrl": "https://ec2-11-22-33-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com:443",
        "sharedSecret": "sharedSecret",
        "enabled": false,
        "status": "NEW_NOT_VERIFIED",
        "version": 1,
        "createdAt": "2018-06-10T16:01:46Z",
        "modifiedAt": "2018-06-10T16:01:46Z"
    }
}
~~~

As you could see, the status is **NEW_NOT_VERIFIED**, which means that he webhook wasn't enabled yet.

### Enable the webhook 1
According to the documentation we need to use the PUT request and change the **enabled: true**.
> When Smartsheet receives the request to enable the webhook, it sends a verification request to the subscriber (that is, to the callbackUrl that the API client specified in the Create Webhook request). The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains only challenge and webhookId in the request body.

The header fields remain the same, but the Body is changing:
[![alt text](/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm3.png "Postman Example PUT Body")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmkravch/dmkravch.github.io/master/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/sm3.png)

As soon as you submit this request, the Smartsheet cloud will send the following POST request to your **callbackUrl** (in my fake obfuscated example it's https://ec2-11-22-33-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com:443)
[![alt text](/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/rb1.png "Request bin response")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmkravch/dmkravch.github.io/master/img/2018-06-11-smartsheet-webhooks-aws-ec2-le/rb1.png)

But nothing really happens, as we don't have the backend to echo this request.

### EC2 AMI instance configuration/preparations

We were researching a lot on how to secure the communication between Smartsheet cloud and EC2 instance. The reason for that, Smartsheet requires only publicly (CA) signed certificates. If you try to use self-signed certificates, you would get the **DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED** with the description that both parties couldn't agree on the security level. Example:
~~~
"status": "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED",
"disabledDetails": "An error occurred during SSL handshake: the client and server could not negotiate the desired level of security. (ref id: orqvg6xzjou2)",
~~~

> We've tried both, AWS Certificate Manager and [Let'sEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), but they both failed to create a certificate for AWS owned DNS.

The only solution for us was to purchase a valid DNS name and create a certificate for it. The procedure is the following.
1. Use [Amazon Route 53](Amazon Route 53) to purchase a domain.
2. In the **Hosted Zone** configuration create an **A** pointer to your EC2 instance.
3. Use the Let'sEncrypt free service to create a public certificate. We were using [Deploying Letâ€™s Encrypt on an Amazon Linux AMI EC2 Instance](https://medium.com/@gnowland/deploying-lets-encrypt-on-an-amazon-linux-ami-ec2-instance-f8e2e8f4fc1f) post as a reference.
4. And don't forget to open the port 443 in AWS Web interface for your EC2 instance.

### Flask/Script configuration

One of the requirements for webhook to be enabled, is that the application echoes the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** as **Smartsheet-Hook-Response**.
Example of the code and how it could be accomplished, could be found below:
~~~python
import json, requests
from flask import Flask, request
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='LogFile.log', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s %(message)s')

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def handle_message():
    data = request.get_json()
    logging.debug(data)
    try:
        challenge=data['challenge']
        #The line below is actually generates a 200 OK response with the smartsheetHookResponse
        return json.dumps({'smartsheetHookResponse':challenge}), 200, {'ContentType':'application/json'}
    except Exception as inst:
        logging.debug(inst)
    else:
        logging.debug("ok")
        return "ok"

app.run(host='ec2-11-22-33-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com',port=443,
#those are the certificates generated by the Let'sEncrypt service
        ssl_context=('/etc/letsencrypt/live/lets-collaborate.net/fullchain.pem', '/etc/letsencrypt/live/lets-collaborate.net/privkey.pem'))
~~~

Tutorial on how to run Flak with HTTPS is [Running Your Flask Application Over HTTPS](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/running-your-flask-application-over-https)

And finaly, we need to run our python script to enable Flask to receive requests:
~~~
python your-script.py
~~~

### Enable the webhook 2
Now, when you try to enable your webhook, it should return something like this, with the **ENABLED** status:
~~~json
{
    "message": "SUCCESS",
    "resultCode": 0,
    "result": {
        "id": 1234567890,
        "name": "Webhook dmkravch",
        "scope": "sheet",
        "scopeObjectId": 987654321,
        "events": [
            "*.*"
        ],
        "callbackUrl": "https://your-purchased-domain:443",
        "sharedSecret": "sharedSecret",
        "enabled": true,
        "status": "ENABLED",
        "version": 1,
        "createdAt": "2018-06-10T18:15:11Z",
        "modifiedAt": "2018-06-10T18:49:13Z"
    }
}
~~~

### Checking the output from the Smartsheet
Now in the _LogFile.log_ you should see whenever anyone make any change to the sheet in question. It won't share the exact changes, but rather references on what has happened. And then, to retrieve those we need to use the [Get Row](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/?python#get-row) API, but it's a different story.


## Summary
So, the main challenge was the enforced security by Smartsheet, which required a publicly (CA) signed certificate. We needed a custom domain, because none of the CA would sigh AWS hostname. After purchasing a DNS name and creating a certificate with the Let'sEncrypt service, the webhook creation went well.   

Thank you very much and hope it will help you to save time.
