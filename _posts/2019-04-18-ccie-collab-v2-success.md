This is a blog post about passing relatively new CCIE Collaboration v2, and becoming one of the first 10 people in the world who passed the version 2 of the exam. This post is about general concepts and approaches that should be done in order to be successful with the exam, from my perspective of course.

The exam itself is balanced and quite interesting to prepare to. The exam is testing not only the technical knowledge, but also commitment, endurance and abilities to adapt. I highly recommend to take it, if you are still deciding.

# My Journey
With 6 years of experience in Collaboration domain I've decided to pursue this certification.

I was ready to start actively preparing in the beginning of 2018, and at the same time it was announced that the blueprint will be changed starting from July 23 2018. The plan was to pass until the changes, as we all more or less new what to expect. However, my manager and friend Manpreet advised me to wait for the new version of both, written and the lab exams. I did. And I'm very glad that I've followed the advised, and didn't join the **"golden rush"** of passing the previous CCIE Collaboration v1 blueprint.

It took me some time to pass the Written part of the exam, as I was targeting the new version and there were no official Study Guides or something similar. I will talk later on what exactly I used to prepare myself. And in the mid-October the Written was passed. I had some time to switch off as in one week was my wedding. I'm was lucky that my then-fianc√© Mariya took almost all responsibilities for the wedding so I could concentrate on preparing to the test.  

I've started preparing for the Lab in November 2018 by building it. From scratch. We've got some UCS servers, which we placed in the rack, found available IPs and started building the topology. After some hiccups the Lab was ready right after Christmas holidays and I could continue with technology learning and practising. My first attempt was scheduled for the end-February 2019. I felt prepared, but failed Troubleshooting and Configuration sections.

And my first advise to you would be, as soon as you back in the hotel or airport, **write down everything you remember from the exam**. I'd made a mistake not recording it, as I felt exhausted, and felt confident that I'll be able to recall it later. Don't neglect it and take time and try to remember everything what was there, as it will be essential in case the first attempt not successful.

It was terrible to wait for results, recalling questions that I most likely failed, thinking what I could've done differently and not knowing how my next month would look like. I received the results on the second day in the morning, and it was Fail.

My advise to you, even if you failed your first attempt, **schedule the second one as soon as possible** (of course you need to wait 30 days before any re-attempt). Because, in my opinion, any day you wait longer will fade-out some concepts or steps in the configuration process.

My second attempt was at the end of March. I needed to return to my duties at work, but still kept on practicing during weekends.
Due to family situation, I needed to push the attempt a couple of days forward. There is a fee you need to pay, and you cannot reschedule the exam less than 3 days before the actual attempt.

 I've moved it to the very end of March.

Not everything works as in real life, but you need to approach that from different sides as it could be not so obvious or staright forward.


And don't forget to celebrate with the loved once, as it's very important and we tend to neglect that part.
